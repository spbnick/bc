        We can use the same footprint for both LEDs:

        Pads close to speakers?

TODO
    See if we can just switch to red LEDs and connect them to the battery
    directly. They have the lowest voltage drop.
        - no, they're not bright enough

What do we want with the backlight? In order of priority:
    Sufficient illumination for our design, i.e. enough brightness.
    Low power consumption
    Low component cost
Non-negotiable constraints:
    Supply voltage 2-3V
    Space
    MCU pin count
Options:
    Charge pumps with multiplexing
        - Efficiency might not be good, power consumption too high,
          but needs measuring
        + Cheap
    Boost converter driver with current-limiting resistors and switching with
    open-collector pins
        Extra components

OK, we cannot do a perfect lightpipe. We can't do a 3D-printed lightpipe at
all, actually. We can do a reflective enclosure, plus a poor 3D-printed
diffuser. That will have to be good enough.

What we need to get it further:
* We need to have copper covering the light where we don't need it, on either
  side.
    * We can't have it come all the way to the LED on the LED side, but we can
      have it come all the way everywhere else, and cover the LED on the other
      side. This way we can keep the impression of disconnected tactile
      ("bumpy") keys.

TODO
    Find out the capacitance and frequency sufficient for the key backlight
        390nF±10% at 10kHz is enough for two LEDs
        Two 390nF±10% capacitors (735nF total) at 5kHz is good for two LEDs too
        Three 390nF±10% capacitors (1.1uF total) was good at 4kHz for two LEDs
    Find out if 50% fill keys can be sensed
    Find out if the 50% fill keys can be sensed with LEDs on and pulsing
    Make the sound work with the amplifier
        Done, but the CR2016 battery died very fast - too much current
        We need to switch to double AAA batteries
    Make the sound work with the MCU ADC
    Make sound generation work
    Make sound mixing work
    Figure out a way to fix the 3D-printed case to the PCB (or the other way around)
        Using Keystone 5019 test point or 110 battery contact to couple with
        the 3D-printed case
    Check if maybe the piezo transducers could work for us with less power
    (unlikely)
        Actually they could. Wouldn't sound good, but consumes much less
        power.
    Verify transducer power consumption

Shall we do another prototype just using an smd transducer?
We won't have to have so much filtering for low power transducer, then.
We could have pads for both kinds of fasteners, just to try them out.
We could have the simplest possible key shapes to make it easier.
We could have cr2032 as the power supply
Could be fun and look neat, even though it won't sound good!
We can put the transducer onto the ADC pin in case we want to use it.
